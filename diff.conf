#: Diffing {{{

# syntax_aliases pyj:py pyi:py recipe:py

#: File extension aliases for syntax highlight. For example, to syntax
#: highlight file.xyz as file.abc use a setting of xyz:abc. Multiple
#: aliases must be separated by spaces.

# num_context_lines 3

#: The number of lines of context to show around each change.

# diff_cmd auto

#: The diff command to use. Must contain the placeholder _CONTEXT_
#: which will be replaced by the number of lines of context. A few
#: special values are allowed: auto will automatically pick an
#: available diff implementation. builtin will use the anchored diff
#: algorithm from the Go standard library. git will use the git
#: command to do the diffing. diff will use the diff command to do the
#: diffing.

# replace_tab_by \x20\x20\x20\x20

#: The string to replace tabs with. Default is to use four spaces.

# ignore_name

#: A glob pattern that is matched against only the filename of files
#: and directories. Matching files and directories are ignored when
#: scanning the filesystem to look for files to diff. Can be specified
#: multiple times to use multiple patterns. For example::

#:     ignore_name .git
#:     ignore_name *~
#:     ignore_name *.pyc

# pygments_style default

#: the general colors use the settings below.
